# Happy passengers

Hi there!
This small and not so fun project is my sandbox for investiagation of Unity and Unity's project architecture.
So please fill free to be severe :)

## Getting Started

It's conceived to be mobile game with swiping input. But for now it's Windows project to make development fast, so input setting and gameplay is not completely finished. As well as architecture ;)

### Prerequisites

You need to have installed Unity 2017.1.1f
